        I would recommend this book to anyone who endeavors to be a lifelong
        learner. I also recommend that you read it ASAP if you are interested in
        it, as it will change the way you approach everything thereafter. I'm
        upset that this wasn't a part of my high school curriculum.

        Despite the absurd title, the book's core is rather worthwhile, though
        it could use a thorough editing to bring it well under 150 pages. The
        text is overly verbose and far too repetitive to fill out 350 pages
        comfortably. Even its entire first 3 chapters can be completely skipped.
        (He thinks that the "lowest level of reading" is comprehension. That's
        it. I saved you ~45 pages of posturing.)

        At his worst Adler is pretentious, pompous, and belittling. He makes no
        attempt, for example, to understand why one would read an important book
        before bed unless one was a moron, and he then goes on to insist that
        he's better at reading himself to sleep than you are. Pointless little
        oddities like this mar the text and keep it from being the sort of book
        you could recommend to anyone.

        But at its best, HtRaB offers an insightful suggestion about how to
        thoroughly glean the meatiest parts of a serious book and how to
        categorize it in your mind for future reference should the need arise to
        read the work in full. It is well-tailored to a research project where
        you have hundreds of potential works to pull from but limited time for
        sifting. The method works well for chewing through books beyond this
        context as well.

          I believe this book has shaped the way I shop permanently
        </strong>. I am the sort of person who amasses too many paperbacks just
        in case I want to read them someday, but I now feel that I will peruse a
        digital copy when able to first determine whether or not I even feel
        compelled to give the text a more thorough read. I also feel strongly
        motivated to "systematically skim" (as he puts it) my entire back
        catalog of 70-odd books I have not yet opened. Indeed I feel a bit
        foolish for having bought so many when I know that, statistically, at
        least 25% will reveal themselves after a half-hour skim to not be worth
        reading in full.

        It's important to note that the book is from 1940, a time when
        self-publishing was an extreme rarity and published books had a high
        quality bar, so being a book just by itself was generally an indicator
        of quality. Adler's note-taking techniques, even in the 1972 update,
        predate computing. Some of his advice about reading or focusing on
        various parts of books like the dust jacket also does not translate well
        to the 2020s. The process is ripe for modernization.

          <strong>Quick Rundown</strong>: Read chapters 4 and 5 of this book,
          then apply them to the book itself. Read chapter 20 before you put the
          book down. You're welcome.
