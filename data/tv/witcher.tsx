          <p>
            Every other fantasy series lacks in quality and / or worldbuilding.
            Across eight tight episodes, the first season of The Witcher manages
            to avoid both, realizing a dark and vulgar realm with the
            craftsmanship of prestige TV. As someone who did <em>not</em>{" "}
            enjoy the games, I fully expected to roll my eyes at this, yet that
            never happened.
          </p>

          <p>
            I have one personal complaint: based on my expectations from the
            games, I don't agree with Yennefer's casting. However as a
            standalone interpretation separate from the games, there is
            absolutely nothing wrong with{" "}
            <Link.Wiki to="Anya_Chalotra" />'s performance, and rest of the cast
            is great. Special shoutouts to Tissaia
            (<Link.Wiki to="MyAnna_Buring" />) and Jaskier
            (<Link.Wiki to="Joey_Batey" />) who always delighted.

            entirely and ought to have been edited away. Some arcs and
            characters do stand out - Fringilla
            (<Link.Wiki to="MimÃ®_M._Khayisa" />) in particular - and for that it
            is still worth watching.
